<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>At 24 Hour Truck Repair, our mission is simple: <strong>to stand by the men and women who keep this country moving</strong> — especially when no one else will.</p>
<p>We know what -45°F feels like. We’ve felt the wind slice through gloves, the sting of steel that bites skin, and the silence of a dead engine in the middle of nowhere. In those brutal Nebraska winters, when the roads are empty and the rest of the world is asleep, truckers don’t stop — and neither do we.</p>
<p>We’re a small, locally-owned repair service built from cold nights, hard work, and a whole lot of grit. What started with a wrench and a beat-up pickup has become a lifeline for drivers stranded in freezing dark — drivers with families waiting on the other end of the haul.</p>
<p><strong>We don’t just fix trucks. We bring warmth back to cabs, life back to engines, and hope back to drivers who feel forgotten.</strong></p>
<p>This business is more than a job — it’s a promise. <br>To every trucker who’s ever prayed for help on a frozen highway: <strong>we’re coming.</strong></p>
<p>Because no one deserves to freeze alone in the dark.</p>
